summary: Matrix server and channel are finally here!
---

Finally, I managed to create a matrix server to host the `#terranix:terranix.org` chat room.
Looking forward to talk to you! All you need is a matrix client and an account.

If you don't know where to start, just use element and create an account on `matrix.org`.
